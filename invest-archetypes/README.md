# Invest Archetypes

You need to build and install these to your local machine.

Firstly ensure you've installed the rest of the Invest Java projects using:

```
mvn install
```

For each archetype you wish you use run:

```
./generate-archetype.sh
./install-archetype.sh
```

In order to generate a project using them, first move to the directory in which you want to create the project directory and then run:

```
mvn archetype:generate
```

You can find the archetypes (if not obivious) by filteering.
